### Frequently Asked Questions:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
##### WHAT'S THIS?
- For some people, manually extracting game files to mount them onto Garry's Mod Classic can be frustrating. With this tool, just by running it once, it extracts the game files of your choice to the folder of Garry's Mod Classic.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
##### MY GARRYSMOD FOLDER HAS A DIFFERENT NAME.
- I'll implement this feature later, for now just go into "(your steam folder)/steamapps/sourcemods/garrysmod/addons" and copy the folders over to the correct Garry's Mod Classic addons folder.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
##### WINDOWS DEFENDER MARKED IT AS UNSAFE
- The batch file is COMPLETELY SAFE, whatever else Windows tells you. If you don't want to use it, then don't.
It looks in the registry for the Steam path, probably this triggers Windows Defender to block the file.
To get over this, you must click "More info" and then click the "Run Anyway" option.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
##### HOW DO I DELETE MOUNTED CONTENT?
- If you want to delete mounted content, look in the folder where you installed Garry's Mod Classic to, and follow these folders:
"(your installating folder)/garrysmod/addons/mount_(game name here)"
and proceed to delete the folders which you don't wish to have anymore.
